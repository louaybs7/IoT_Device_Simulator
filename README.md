# IoT_Device_Simulator
In this exciting assignment, you will create a Python-based IoT device simulator that emulates the behavior of
a real IoT device. The simulator should be able to handle sensor data, perform basic analytics, and
communicate with a central server. To make it more engaging, you'll also build a monitoring dashboard to
display the collected sensor data and analytics results. This assignment will help you sharpen your Python
programming skills, including data structures, classes, OOP objects, instance and class variables, OOP
methods, pip, static methods, files & standard library, exception handling, modules, and packages.
